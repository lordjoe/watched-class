A common situation in the development of a large application is that the developer observes the symptoms of a memory leak,  continuing and unexpected increases in the memory.  Finding the source  of these memory leaks can be a significant problem. Profiling the application is an option.  The tools described here are simple and easy when the following conditions are met: a) the developer believes that  a class whose code he controls is causing the  problem  b) The developer is willing to make temporary modifications in the code to examine the issue.  c) The developer is interested in where in the code the leaked objects are created so he can track where references to them might be stored.
